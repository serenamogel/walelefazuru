Easy to spot due to his signature long hair and striking beard, he became a major star in the fall of 2015 when his debut solo album, Traveller, practically swept the CMAs. Stapleton followed up the multiplatinum album by drawing on his own vast repertoire of songs. In 2017, he released two more albums: the award-winning From a Room: Volume 1 and From a Room: Volume 2. In total, Stapleton has won 10 Grammys and is a seven-time Country Music Association Male Vocalist of the Year—more than any artist in history.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Christopher Alvin Stapleton<br>BORN: April 15, 1978<br>BIRTHPLACE: Lexington, Kentucky<br>SPOUSE: Morgane Stapleton (2007-present)<br>CHILDREN: Waylon, Ada, Macon, Samuel, and 1 son (name unknown)<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Early Years" data-anchor-id=early-years class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Christopher Alvin Stapleton was born on April 15, 1978, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Carol Stapleton, a local health department worker, and Herbert Stapleton Jr., a coal miner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with his older brother, Herbert, and younger sister, Melanie, Chris grew up outside of Lexington where his parents were active listeners of country artists from the region.“It’s just part of the fabric of being from Kentucky,” Stapleton said in a 2015 with the Lexington Herald Leader. “Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley, Dwight Yoakam and Patty Loveless, the list goes on and on. Those names are just part of life in Kentucky. You can’t help but be aware of them and be influenced by them. It’s almost genetic in the sense that you don’t have an existence that doesn’t involve their music.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Popular and clean-cut in his teenage years, Stapleton played several team sports at Johnson Central High School and graduated as class valedictorian in 1996. Twenty years later, he returned to his high school to play a free concert and dedicate a new space, built by student carpenters, where students can perform on school grounds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After high school, Stapleton went on to study engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, but soon immersed himself in the local music scene and dropped out after one year.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other 2023 CMA Award Nominees</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 title="Songwriting Career" data-anchor-id=songwriting-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Songwriting Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After meeting some local songwriters in his hometown, Stapleton discovered that songwriting was a viable profession. In a 2016 interview with CBS News, he said: “I always thought that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/george-strait data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Strait" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Strait</a> was singing a song, he made it up, and that was the end of it. But the instant I found out that that could be a job, I thought, ‘That’s the job for me.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2001, Stapleton landed a publishing deal just four days after moving to Nashville. For the next decade or so, he scored an impressive number of hits with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/g45702018/famous-country-singers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="famous country musicians" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">famous country musicians</a>, including Strait (“Love’s Gonna Make It Alright”), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kenny-chesney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kenny Chesney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kenny Chesney</a> (“Never Wanted Nothing More”), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/luke-bryan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Luke Bryan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Luke Bryan</a> (“Drink a Beer”), Thomas Rhett (“Crash and Burn”), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/darius-rucker data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Darius Rucker" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Darius Rucker</a> (“Come Back Song”), and Josh Turner (“Your Man”).

The band released two albums—a self-titled debut and Reckless—and earned three Grammy nominations. He then formed the Jompson Brothers rock group in 2010. That group released one album and toured briefly as an opening act for Zac Brown Band.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2013, Stapleton signed with Mercury Nashville. His single “What Are You Listening To?” released that October but didn’t go anywhere, so its accompanying album was scrapped. He then hooked up with co-producer Dave Cobb to record Traveller, his solo debut. The album appeared in May 2015 to strong reviews but didn’t receive wide airplay until after the CMAs where it won Album of the Year. Also at the November awards ceremony, Stapleton was named New Artist of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year. Traveller’s “Nobody to Blame” became his first country radio hit, and “Parachute” charted even higher later in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stapleton spent the rest of 2015 working on his second album with Cobb and his wife, Morgane, who handpicked the majority of the album’s songs from Stapleton’s library of more than a 1,000 published tunes. From a Room: Volume 1 came out in May 2017 and won the CMA award for Album of the Year. In November 2017, he released From a Room: Volume 2.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 title=Awards data-anchor-id=awards class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Awards</h2><img alt="chris stapleton holding three crystal trophies from an award show" title="Chris Stapleton is a winner at the CMA Awards" width=3000 height=2349 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/male-vocalist-of-the-year-winner-chris-stapleton-poses-in-news-photo-1699480735.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Chris Stapleton holds his trophies from the 2015 CMA Awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In fall 2015, Stapleton became the first artist ever to win Album of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, and New Artist of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards.
