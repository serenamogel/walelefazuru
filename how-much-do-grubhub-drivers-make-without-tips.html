During active delivery time you are guaranteed to be paid at least 120% of the local minimum wage at your pickup location, plus $. 30 per mile compensation driven during active delivery time. And, of course, you will continue to receive 100% of tips.<h2>Do drivers know if you tip?</h2>When your driver rates you, they also won't know if you've tipped, so a bad tip — or no tip — won't affect your rating.<h2>Does Grubhub give you a bag?</h2>Grubhub and our restaurant partners require you to bring an insulated delivery bag when picking up an order. You will receive a free Insulated Grubhub bag after your 1st delivery.<h2>What pays more DoorDash or Postmates?</h2>While it's possible to earn about $20 per hour delivering for either service, reports show Postmates drivers tend to earn a little more.
