John Astin’s</b> <b>net worth</b><span> is believed to be </span><b>$6 million.</b><span> His excellent profession as an actor is obviously his primary source of money.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Career</h2><p>Astin began his acting career in the theater. He relocated to New York with the hopes of making a professional breakthrough. During those idealistic years, he had to take up menial jobs to keep himself afloat. He was a sweeper at a ‘Off-Broadway theater that put up the New York classic ‘The Threepenny Opera.’ John Astin joined the founding cast of the show in 1954, only a few years after relocating to New York. He was cast in the show’s second season in 1955 and stayed on until December 1961.</p><p>While pursuing his career in ‘Broadway’ and ‘Off-Broadway’ plays, Astin worked as a voice artist for cartoons and advertisements on TV. He starred in a number of films throughout the 1960s, including ‘That Touch of Mink’ (1962), ‘Move Over Darling’ (1963), ‘The Wheeler Dealers (1963), ‘The Spirit Is Willing’ (1967), ‘Candy’ (1968), and ‘Viva Max!’ (1969). Between 1967 and 1970, Astin appeared in a variety of TV series, including ‘The Wild Wild West,’ ‘The Flying Nun,’ ‘Death Valley Days,’ ‘Bonanza,’ and ‘The Odd Couple.’ Astin was featured three times in ‘Night Gallery’ in 1971 and 1972, each time in a different avatar.</p><p>John Astin returned to ‘Johns Hopkins in 2001 to resurrect their theater department, and he has taught there ever since. The Merrick Barn’s theater was renamed ‘John Astin Theatre’ in 2011 to honor his commitment to the art of drama and his efforts to effectively revitalize the drama course at ‘Johns Hopkins.’ Astin, who is a decade short of a century, intends to reinstate theatre as a major degree at the institution. Astin continued to appear on television and in films while teaching. His most recent production was the 2017 animated series ‘Justice League Action,’ for which he served as a voice artist.

They had a brief affair that terminated mostly due to Astin’s married status. Astin, on the other hand, wasted little time in marrying Patty Duke on August 5, 1972. Astin adopted Patty’s former relationship’s kid, Sean Astin (a well-known actor from the ‘LOTR’ trilogy). Mackenzie Astin, their youngest son, was born on May 12, 1973.
