Peters designed a short wig that <strong>Barbra Streisand</strong> wore for the comedy <strong>For Pete’s Sake</strong> (1974) to which the couple began a relationship.</p><p>Peters later produced Streisand’s studio album ButterFly (1974) and also gained a producing credit on Streisand’s remake of A Star Is Born (1976), although the extent of his contribution has been disputed. From 1989 until 1991, he also worked alongside Peter Guber for the next 10 years with whom he headed Sony Pictures Entertainment.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jon-peters-a-star-is-born></span><span>Jon Peters A Star Is Born</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John Peters received producing credit on Barbra Streisand’s remake of A Star Is Born (1976), although the extent of his contribution has been disputed. A Star Is Born is a 1976 American musical romantic drama film about a young singer (Barbra Streisand) who meets and falls in love with an established rock and roll star (Kris Kristofferson), only to find her career ascending while his goes into decline.</p><p>This film is a remake of the 1937 original drama starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, which had also been adapted in 1954 as a musical starring Judy Garland and James Mason. In 2018, the story was again adapted starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jon-peters-book></span><span>Jon Peters Book</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Deadline Hollywood blog (owned by Nikki Finke) reported on a book proposal for the autobiography of Peters, written by himself and Los Angeles writer William Stadium. Jon Peters reportedly intended to write about his life with Streisand and a string of other celebrity lovers.</p><p>Peters subsequently withdrew in 2009, from the HarperCollins book deal after adverse publicity. It was triggered by the leaking of the proposal and potential lawsuits.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-peters-superman></span><span>John Peters Superman</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jon Peters bought the film rights to the Superman franchise from Warner Bros in the early 1990s. Writer/director Kevin Smith talked about working for Peters when he was hired to write a script for a new Superman film which was then called Superman Reborn and later Superman Lives in his Q&A/comedy DVD An Evening With Kevin Smith. Peters had expressed disdain for most of Superman’s iconic characteristics by demanding that Superman was never to fly nor appear in his trademark costume according to Smith.</p><p>Peters also suggested Sean Penn as being ideal for the role based on his performance as a death row inmate in Dead Man Walking in which he said that Penn had the eyes of a “caged animal, a fucking killer.” Peters then demanded that the third act of the film include a fight between Superman and a giant spider, to be unveiled in an homage to King Kong. Peters later produced the 1999 steampunk western comedy Wild Wild West, the finale of which featured a giant mechanical spider.</p><p>Smith met Peters after completing a script and Peters instructed him to include a robot sidekick for Brainiac, a fight scene between Brainiac and two polar bears, and a marketable “space dog” pet similar to Star Wars character Chewbacca. Smith inserted them into his script but the project was then abandoned and the script discarded.</p><p>In Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman, Peters admitted that the Superman franchise was problematic for him: “The elements that I was focusing on were away from the heart, it was more leaning towards ‘Star Wars’ in a sense, you know. I didn’t realize the human part of it, I didn’t have that.”</p><p>He subsequently served as a producer for Superman Returns, the 2006 Superman film directed by Bryan Singer, and as an executive producer for Man of Steel, the 2013 Superman film directed by Zack Snyder. Peters was banned from the Man of Steel set by producer Christopher Nolan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jon-peters-sandman></span><span>Jon Peters Sandman</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jon Peters was a producer for a planned adaptation of the Sandman comics for Warner Bros., which met with controversy. One draft script commissioned by Peters has reviewed on the Internet at Ain’t It Cool News and was met with scorn. Sandman creator Neil Gaiman called the last screenplay that Warner Bros. would send him “…not only the worst Sandman script I’ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I’ve ever read.” The project had become stranded in development hell by 2001.</p><p>Gaiman commented: “But Sandman movies, they just got increasingly appalling. It was really strange. They started out hiring some really good people and you got Elliott and Rossio and Roger Avary came in and did a draft. They were all solid scripts. And then Jon Peters fired all of them and got in some people who take orders, and who wanted fistfights and all this stuff. It had no sensibility and it was just…they were horrible,” in a 2005 interview.</p><p>Jon Peters gained huge net worth by becoming a multi-award-winning producer over 30 years. He also managed Barbara Streisand’s early music and film career during the 1970s. Peters has an estimated net worth of $200 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jon-peters-movies></span><span>Jon Peters Movies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>1976, A Star Is Born</li><li>1978, Eyes of Laura Mars</li><li>1979, The Main Event</li><li>1980, Die Laughing</li><li>Caddyshack</li><li>1981, An American Werewolf in London</li><li>1982, Missing</li><li>Six Weeks</li></ul><ul><li>1990, The Bonfire of the Vanities</li><li>1992, Batman Returns</li><li>1993, This Boy’s Life</li><li>1994, With Honors</li><li>1995, Money Train</li><li>1996, My Fellow Americans</li><li>1997, Rosewood</li></ul><ul><li>1999, Wild Wild West</li><li>2001, Ali</li><li>2006, Superman Returns</li><li>2013, Man of Steel</li><li>2018, A Star Is Born</li></ul><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-jon-peter></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Jon Peter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jon-peters></span><span>Who is Jon Peters?&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jon Peters is well known, film producer and also a former hairdresser.
