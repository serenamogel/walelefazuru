Gifted with a curious mind and a brilliant intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which greatly informed his work. His drawings, paintings and other works have influenced countless artists and engineers over the centuries.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci was born in a farmhouse outside the village of Anchiano in Tuscany, Italy (about 18 miles west of Florence) on April 15, 1452.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born out of wedlock to respected Florentine notary Ser Piero and a young peasant woman named Caterina, da Vinci was raised by his father and his stepmother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of five, he moved to his father’s estate in nearby Vinci (the town from which his surname derives), where he lived with his uncle and grandparents.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Young da Vinci received little formal education beyond basic reading, writing and mathematics instruction, but his artistic talents were evident from an early age.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around the age of 14, da Vinci began a lengthy apprenticeship with the noted artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. He learned a wide breadth of technical skills including metalworking, leather arts, carpentry, drawing, painting and sculpting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His earliest known dated work — a pen-and-ink drawing of a landscape in the Arno valley — was sketched in 1473.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Works</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of 20, da Vinci qualified for membership as a master artist in Florence’s Guild of Saint Luke and established his own workshop. However, he continued to collaborate with del Verrocchio for an additional five years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It is thought that del Verrocchio completed his “Baptism of Christ” around 1475 with the help of his student, who painted part of the background and the young angel holding the robe of Jesus.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, written around 1550 by artist Giorgio Vasari, del Verrocchio was so humbled by the superior talent of his pupil that he never picked up a paintbrush again. (Most scholars, however, dismiss Vasari’s account as apocryphal.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1478, after leaving del Verrocchio’s studio, da Vinci received his first independent commission for an altarpiece to reside in a chapel inside Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three years later the Augustinian monks of Florence’s San Donato a Scopeto tasked him to paint “Adoration of the Magi.” The young artist, however, would leave the city and abandon both commissions without ever completing them.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Was Leonardo da Vinci Gay?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Many historians believe that da Vinci was a homosexual: Florentine court records from 1476 show that da Vinci and four other young men were charged with sodomy, a crime punishable by exile or death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After no witnesses showed up to testify against 24-year-old da Vinci, the charges were dropped, but his whereabouts went entirely undocumented for the following two years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Several other famous Florentine artists were also known to have been homosexual, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/michelangelo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Michelangelo class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michelangelo</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/donatello data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Donatello class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donatello</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/sandro-botticelli data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sandro Botticelli" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sandro Botticelli</a>. Indeed, homosexuality was such a fact of artistic life in Renaissance Florence that the word "florenzer" became German slang for “gay.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Leonardo da Vinci: Paintings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although da Vinci is known for his artistic abilities, fewer than two dozen paintings attributed to him exist. One reason is that his interests were so varied that he wasn’t a prolific painter. Da Vinci’s most famous works include the “Vitruvian Man,” “The Last Supper” and the “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/news/the-heist-that-made-the-mona-lisa-famous data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mona Lisa" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mona Lisa</a>.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Vitruvian Man</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Art and science intersected perfectly in da Vinci’s sketch of “Vitruvian Man,” drawn in 1490, which depicted a nude male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart inside both a square and a circle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The now-famous sketch represents da Vinci's study of proportion and symmetry, as well as his desire to relate man to the natural world.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Last Supper</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around 1495, Ludovico Sforza, then the Duke of Milan, commissioned da Vinci to paint “The Last Supper” on the back wall of the dining hall inside the monastery of Milan’s Santa Maria delle Grazie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The masterpiece, which took approximately three years to complete, captures the drama of the moment when Jesus informs the Twelve Apostles gathered for Passover dinner that one of them would soon betray him. The range of facial expressions and the body language of the figures around the table bring the masterful composition to life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The decision by da Vinci to paint with tempera and oil on dried plaster instead of painting a fresco on fresh plaster led to the quick deterioration and flaking of “The Last Supper.” Although an improper restoration caused further damage to the mural, it has now been stabilized using modern conservation techniques.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mona Lisa</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1503, da Vinci started working on what would become his most well-known painting — and arguably the most famous painting in the world —the “Mona Lisa.” The privately commissioned work is characterized by the enigmatic smile of the woman in the half-portrait, which derives from da Vinci’s sfumato technique.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Adding to the allure of the “Mona Lisa” is the mystery surrounding the identity of the subject. Princess Isabella of Naples, an unnamed courtesan and da Vinci’s own mother have all been put forth as potential sitters for the masterpiece. It has even been speculated that the subject wasn’t a female at all but da Vinci’s longtime apprentice Salai dressed in women’s clothing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Based on accounts from an early biographer, however, the "Mona Lisa" is a picture of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant. The painting’s original Italian name — “La Gioconda” — supports the theory, but it’s far from certain. Some art historians believe the merchant commissioned the portrait to celebrate the pending birth of the couple’s next child, which means the subject could have been pregnant at the time of the painting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">If the Giocondo family did indeed commission the painting, they never received it. For da Vinci, the "Mona Lisa" was forever a work in progress, as it was his attempt at perfection, and he never parted with the painting. Today, the "Mona Lisa" hangs in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.louvre.fr/en data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Louvre Museum" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Louvre Museum</a> in Paris, France, secured behind bulletproof glass and regarded as a priceless national treasure seen by millions of visitors each year.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Battle of Anghiari</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1503, da Vinci also started work on the "Battle of Anghiari," a mural commissioned for the council hall in the Palazzo Vecchio that was to be twice as large as "The Last Supper."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He abandoned the "Battle of Anghiari" project after two years when the mural began to deteriorate before he had a chance to finish it.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Inventions</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1482, Florentine ruler <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/lorenzo-de-medici data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lorenzo de' Medici" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lorenzo de' Medici</a> commissioned da Vinci to create a silver lyre and bring it as a peace gesture to Ludovico Sforza. After doing so, da Vinci lobbied Ludovico for a job and sent the future Duke of Milan a letter that barely mentioned his considerable talents as an artist and instead touted his more marketable skills as a military engineer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Using his inventive mind, da Vinci sketched war machines such as a war chariot with scythe blades mounted on the sides, an armored tank propelled by two men cranking a shaft and even an enormous crossbow that required a small army of men to operate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The letter worked, and Ludovico brought da Vinci to Milan for a tenure that would last 17 years. During his time in Milan, da Vinci was commissioned to work on numerous artistic projects as well, including “The Last Supper.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci’s ability to be employed by the Sforza clan as an architecture and military engineering advisor as well as a painter and sculptor spoke to da Vinci’s keen intellect and curiosity about a wide variety of subjects.</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Flying Machine</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Always a man ahead of his time, da Vinci appeared to prophesy the future with his sketches of devices that resemble a modern-day bicycle and a type of helicopter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perhaps his most well-known invention is a flying machine, which is based on the physiology of a bat. These and other explorations into the mechanics of flight are found in da Vinci's Codex on the Flight of Birds, a study of avian aeronautics, which he began in 1505.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like many leaders of Renaissance humanism, da Vinci did not see a divide between science and art. He viewed the two as intertwined disciplines rather than separate ones. He believed studying science made him a better artist.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1502 and 1503, da Vinci also briefly worked in Florence as a military engineer for Cesare Borgia, the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI and commander of the papal army. He traveled outside of Florence to survey military construction projects and sketch city plans and topographical maps.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He designed plans, possibly with noted diplomat <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/niccolo-machiavelli data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Niccolò Machiavelli" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>, to divert the Arno River away from rival Pisa in order to deny its wartime enemy access to the sea.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80/MTY2MzU4MjI1NjI3NjUzODIz/leonardodavinci_facts_desktop.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S LEONARDO DA VINCI FACT CARD" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><strong>DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S LEONARDO DA VINCI FACT CARD</strong></a></p><img alt="Leonardo da Vinci Fact Card" title="Leonardo da Vinci Fact Card" width=600 height=1437 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leonardodavinci_facts_desktop.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=54 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci’s Study of Anatomy and Science</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci thought sight was humankind’s most important sense and eyes the most important organ, and he stressed the importance of saper vedere, or “knowing how to see.” He believed in the accumulation of direct knowledge and facts through observation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“A good painter has two chief objects to paint — man and the intention of his soul,” da Vinci wrote. “The former is easy, the latter hard, for it must be expressed by gestures and the movement of the limbs.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To more accurately depict those gestures and movements, da Vinci began to study anatomy seriously and dissect human and animal bodies during the 1480s. His drawings of a fetus in utero, the heart and vascular system, sex organs and other bone and muscular structures are some of the first on human record.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his anatomical investigations, da Vinci studied botany, geology, zoology, hydraulics, aeronautics and physics. He sketched his observations on loose sheets of papers and pads that he tucked inside his belt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci placed the papers in notebooks and arranged them around four broad themes—painting, architecture, mechanics and human anatomy. He filled dozens of notebooks with finely drawn illustrations and scientific observations.</p><h2 data-node-id=60 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><h2 data-node-id=61 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sculptures</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ludovico Sforza also tasked da Vinci with sculpting a 16-foot-tall bronze equestrian statue of his father and founder of the family dynasty, Francesco Sforza. With the help of apprentices and students in his workshop, da Vinci worked on the project on and off for more than a dozen years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci sculpted a life-size clay model of the statue, but the project was put on hold when war with France required bronze to be used for casting cannons, not sculptures. After French forces overran Milan in 1499 — and shot the clay model to pieces — da Vinci fled the city along with the duke and the Sforza family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ironically, Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, who led the French forces that conquered Ludovico in 1499, followed in his foe’s footsteps and commissioned da Vinci to sculpt a grand equestrian statue, one that could be mounted on his tomb. After years of work and numerous sketches by da Vinci, Trivulzio decided to scale back the size of the statue, which was ultimately never finished.</p><h2 data-node-id=65 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Final Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci returned to Milan in 1506 to work for the very French rulers who had overtaken the city seven years earlier and forced him to flee.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Among the students who joined his studio was young Milanese aristocrat Francesco Melzi, who would become da Vinci’s closest companion for the rest of his life. He did little painting during his second stint in Milan, however, and most of his time was instead dedicated to scientific studies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=68 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Amid political strife and the temporary expulsion of the French from Milan, da Vinci left the city and moved to Rome in 1513 along with Salai, Melzi and two studio assistants. Giuliano de’ Medici, brother of newly installed Pope Leo X and son of his former patron, gave da Vinci a monthly stipend along with a suite of rooms at his residence inside the Vatican.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His new patron, however, also gave da Vinci little work. Lacking large commissions, he devoted most of his time in Rome to mathematical studies and scientific exploration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After being present at a 1515 meeting between France’s King Francis I and Pope Leo X in Bologna, the new French monarch offered da Vinci the title “Premier Painter and Engineer and Architect to the King.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with Melzi, da Vinci departed for France, never to return. He lived in the Chateau de Cloux (now Clos Luce) near the king’s summer palace along the Loire River in Amboise. As in Rome, da Vinci did little painting during his time in France. One of his last commissioned works was a mechanical lion that could walk and open its chest to reveal a bouquet of lilies.</p><h2 data-node-id=72 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">How Did Leonardo da Vinci Die?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Da Vinci died of a probable stroke on May 2, 1519, at the age of 67. He continued work on his scientific studies until his death; his assistant, Melzi, became the principal heir and executor of his estate.
