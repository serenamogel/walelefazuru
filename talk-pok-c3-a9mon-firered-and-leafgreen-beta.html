Just look at the <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="List of locations by index number (GBA)">index numbers</a>: if Kindle Road is route 1, then our mysterious locations correspond to routes 6–9 and 22–24. (This also gives us a definitive ordering and numbering for the Sevii Islands routes.) But why does all the discussion treat them like they're additional islands? —<a href=# class=new title="User:Typhlosion (page does not exist)">Typhlosion</a> 02:30, 19 August 2010 (UTC)</p>Because the names ingame are 'Sevii Isle 8' and 'Sevii Isle 9'.

At some point the developers must have decided that they wanted to give them names rather than potentially confuse people with two Route 1s in the same game. —<b><span><span>darklord</span><a href=# title="User talk:The dark lord trombonator"><span>trom</span></a></span></b> 23:38, 19 August 2010 (UTC) So at some point there going to be 24 Sevii Islands? If these are "clearly islands," that's exactly what it means. But they aren't clearly islands: the map data for 'Sevii Isle 8' and 'Sevii Isle 9' are prototypical water routes, not new islands. Furthermore, the location index numbers plop these right in the middle of the Sevii Island routes; the cities all come earlier. I don't believe these location indices are evidence that there were going to be <i>more</i> Sevii Islands, but that the existing islands were going to be <i>larger</i>, incorporating more routes until the Sevii Islands were scaled back at some point in production. —<a href=# class=new title="User:Typhlosion (page does not exist)">Typhlosion</a> 19:14, 29 September 2010 (UTC) They are clearly routes as they are programmed as such, given AdvanceMap's output of their map data.

At some point I distracted myself, and when I looked back after hearing a cry, Suicune was there (by the way, my started was a Charmander). The dialog box was there as well, with his cry, like in legendary encounter. He looked to the left and vanished. After that Suicune was added as seen in my Pokédex. I wanted to see it appearing, so I loaded my save and try to do the same thing again, but with no success; I couldn't make him appear.
