Since his debut in Homicide: Life on the Streets, the wisecracking, conspiracy-endorsing, crime-fighting Munch has entertained and delighted fans. His popularity extended far past his viewers, with many directors, and producers inviting the iconic detective to guest star on their dramas. With more than 10 appearances or guest appearances of the beloved character, there are plenty of Munch-isms to go around. The real challenge is picking just ten moments to perfectly encapsulate the sardonic detective and do justice to the late, great <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Richard Belzer</strong></a>.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-homicide-life-on-the-street data-injectable=false>Homicide: Life on the Street</h2><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Homicide: Life on the Street was based on the 1991 book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Written by a journalist who followed the Boston Police Department’s homicide division, the novel served as a blueprint for the television series. Over the course of the year, author David Simon (yes, that David Simon, of The Wire), shadowed the Boys in Blue, he recorded more than 230 murders, many of which informed episodes of Homicide: Life on the Streets. The result is one of the most acclaimed police procedural dramas ever made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Munch-Homicide-life-on-the-street-4.jpg><p data-characters=704 data-current-count=1004 data-injectable=true>When Homicide: Life on the Streets premiered in 1993, it was far from Richard Belzer’s first project; a former comedian, Belzer had a decent run on Saturday Night Live as well as his own television show, The Richard Belzer Show back in 1984. Despite his tenure in the ‘biz, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Belzer said</a> it was an interview he did with Howard Stern that landed him on Homicide: Life on the Streets, largely due to his own paranoid ramblings, opining that “it’s great because I would never be a detective, but if I were, that’s how I’d be. The character is very close to how I’d be. They write to all my paranoia and my establishment dissidence and conspiracy theories.” But on to the Munchisms.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Bayliss</strong>:&nbsp;“So, does the violence make them stupid, or does the stupidity lead to violence?”</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Munch</strong>:&nbsp;“Well, that’s chicken-and-egg semantics. The important point is that we win some cases because our brains are repositories for intelligence, and their brains are day-old banana pudding.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Munch-Homicide-life-on-the-street-3.jpg><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>Just like his character, Belzer was an avid conspiracy theorist; he wrote dozens of books, from materials on classic conspiracies like UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don’t Have to be Crazy to Believe, and Hit List: An In-Depth Investigation into the Mysterious Deaths of Witnesses to the JFK Assassination, to deeper, less-mainstream conspiracies, like&nbsp;Someone Is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? It’s almost as if the role was designed for Belzer himself!</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Munch</strong>:&nbsp;“You’re saving your really good lies for some smarter cop, is that it? I’m just a donut in the on-deck circle. Wait until the real guy gets here. Wait until that big guy comes back. I’m probably just his secretary. I’m just Montel Williams.

If you’re going to lie to me, you lie to me with respect. What is it? Is it my shoes? Is it my haircut? Got a problem with my haircut? Don’t you ever lie to me like I’m Montel Williams.

In fact, there are only three episodes that Belzer doesn’t make an appearance in: “The Damage Done,” “Lines of Fire,” and “The Subway.”</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Munch</strong>:&nbsp;“Homicide: our day begins when yours ends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Munch-Homicide-life-on-the-street-2.jpg><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>One year after Homicide: Life on the Street concluded on the small screen, the cast got back together to send the series out with a bang. A made-for-TV movie, Homicide: The Movie, served as the series’ penultimate episode, and the entire cast returned to properly solve their final case.</p><p data-characters=706 data-current-count=996 data-injectable=true><br><strong>Detective Bolander</strong>: [referencing bird droppings] “Would you look at this?

From a mallard.”<br><strong>Detective Bolander</strong>: “A duck?”<br><strong>Detective Munch</strong>: “A well-fed duck.”<br><strong>Detective Bolander</strong>: “Right, like you can tell the difference. That couldn’t come from a seagull, I suppose?”<br><strong>Detective Munch:</strong> “No, gulls have a milky white splurter. Notice the lobular pattern, these splays within splays.”<br><strong>Detective Bolander</strong>: “Munch… why do you know these things?”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Law & Order SVU</h2><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law and Order: SVU</a> wasn’t Richard Belzer’s first choice for a follow-up series after Homicide: Life on the street. The actor initially asked to be placed in Law & Order, as a partner to Lennie Briscoe (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jerry Orbach</a>) a series he had made frequent guest appearances on. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dick Wolf </a>loved the idea, but had already cast a new partner to play opposite Briscoe, so he offered Belzer a role on SVU instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Munch-Law-Order-SVU.jpg><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>With the character of Munch being partially owned by three parties, there was real potential for the deal to fall through. Originally inspired by David Simon’s depiction of Detective Sergeant Jay Landsman, and then reworked for Homicide: Life on the Street by Tom Fontana&nbsp;and&nbsp;Barry Levinson, there were plenty of people who wanted a slice of that Munch pie. Luckily for viewers everywhere, all three parties came to an agreement, and Munch moved from Baltimore to New York.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Munch</strong>: “I came back from Baltimore after my last marriage broke up. The only opening in my bracket was SVU. Seen enough dead bodies, figured the change would do me good.

He insisted that Dean Winters play the part of his partner, Brian Cassidy. Belzer allegedly told Dick Wolf, “Well, I’ll do this new show of yours,&nbsp;SVU, only if you make Dean Winters my partner.” The only problem: Winters was already under contract for OZ, so he was only available during the series off-season.</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=56 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Cassidy</strong>: “Sure, rain on my parade”</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Munch</strong>: “I don’t want to just rain on it, I wanna blow up all the floats.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/John-Munch-tutuola-Law-Order-SVU.jpg><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Brian Cassidy became a recurring guest character after his Oz obligations look him away from set, but it certainly wasn’t bad news for fans. The remainder of season one featured Monique Jefferies (Michelle Hurd) as his temporary partner, but Hurd departed the show in order to join the cast of Leap Year. Her departure made room for the iconic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice-T</a> to step in as Odafin “Fin” Tutuola.</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=98 data-injectable=false><strong>Detective Munch</strong>: “Dodge ball?

The former rapper loved the ensemble dynamic of the show so much, he moved to New York before his contract was up and became a main cast member. Tutuola and Munch’s somewhat contentious relationship quickly became a fan favorite aspect of SVU.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true><br><strong>Detective Tutuola</strong>: [While searching for a suspect’s cat] “I don’t see a cat.”<br><strong>Detective Munch</strong>: “That doesn’t mean anything.

This iteration of the conspiracy loving detective is a little less conspiratorial, leading fans to believe that it was his time with Mulder (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Duchovny</a>) and Scully (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gillian Anderson</a>) that opened his eyes to the wider world of aliens and monsters.
