<time>09 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>You will remember American actor Edi Gathegi in vampire romantic fantasy, Twilight as Laurent, one of the bloodthirsty vampires.&nbsp;But if you don’t, you must know him from the TV series House as Jeffery Cole.&nbsp;It was a film for the Kenyan actor that graced the big screens in 2006.&nbsp;Here’s everything you need to know about his journey to stardom and why he became so popular.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Edi Gathegi?&nbsp;organic</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Mue Gathegi was born on March 10, 1979 in Nairobi, Kenya to his parents, John N’Gathegi, his father and mother, whose name is unknown.&nbsp;He was quite young when his parents moved to Albany, California, USA to settle.&nbsp;Gathegi, who was interested in basketball, was part of a basketball team at the University of California, where he taught while competing in several competitions.</span></p><p><span>However, after a knee injury, he became discouraged and had to retire from the sport.&nbsp;The episode, which was quite depressing, was the force behind his acting career.&nbsp;He quit school because of the severe depression that plagued him after leaving his favorite sport.&nbsp;Little did Gathegi know at the time that he was venturing into territory that would shape him into who he is today.</span></p><p><span>After taking acting classes, he developed a greater affection for the arts and continued to develop his very special acting skills.&nbsp;Gathegi would not quench the fire in him after he left school;&nbsp;He would pursue a graduate degree at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, graduating in 2005.&nbsp;He had started with productions such as Theater&nbsp;</span><span>Two Trains Run</span><span>&nbsp;at the Old Globe Theatre,&nbsp;</span><span>As You Like It, Twelfth Night, Othello, A Midsummer Night’s Dream</span><span>&nbsp;, and others.</span></p><p><span>The following year after school Gathegi, who was ready and well prepared, took a big step into the film industry.&nbsp;He began appearing on small screens and taking roles in small film productions.&nbsp;He made his professional debut in 2006 when he starred as Haitian Cabbie in the film “Crank.”&nbsp;In 2007 he took on the lead roles&nbsp;</span><span>Death Sentence, The Fifth Patient,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Gone Baby Gone;&nbsp;</span><span>this was after he also made appearances in&nbsp;</span><span>Lincoln Heights</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Veronica Mars</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;He was known for his role in CSI and in particular for his role in the medical series&nbsp;</span><span>House</span><span>&nbsp;where he played Jeffrey Cole.</span></p><span>Edi Gathegi had built a strong profile from his first films before taking on the role of Laurent in Twilight.&nbsp;He also played the same character in a sequel to the film;&nbsp;New moon.&nbsp;Gathegi’s skillful display in Twilight earned him another big role in 2011 when he played Darwin, one of the mutants in the sci-fi film X-Men: First Class.&nbsp;The talented actor has acted in many films in Hollywood, showing his unique talent there.</span><h2><strong><span>His wealth and achievements</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s not wrong to say that the Kenyan-born actor has done enough for himself throughout his acting career.&nbsp;Edi has an estimated net worth of $3 million.</span></p><p><span>He is in fact credited with his unique craft. His net worth could be expected to be a small amount in the years to come as his profile continues to rise.&nbsp;Gathegi has also received a number of awards and nominations throughout his career.&nbsp;One of them is his award for Leading Role at the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – girlfriend, wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi looks like a little lady is known about his private life.&nbsp;The talented actor has kept his personal life very personal, deterring distress from media sources.&nbsp;Despite his friendliness to the ladies, Gathegi, the middle child in his family, never showed up to any lady.&nbsp;This may mean that he is not in a romantic relationship with anyone.&nbsp;The verifiable information about Gathegi is that he is not married at the moment and has no child of his own.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, body stats</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi has a good stature which perfectly matches his acting profession.&nbsp;He stands at a height of 6′ 1” which is quite proportional to his weight of 59 kg.&nbsp;From the description it can be deduced that the slim figure of the actor undoubtedly gives him an advantage over his peers.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMnpuiZZeWwamxxqJkoKGiobOztcSnm2avmZuybrLApqClsV2XvKXFjKyrmqyjYrWmtcahq2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./insalata-di-pesche-radicchio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./insalata-di-pesche-radicchio.html>Peach, Basil &amp;amp; Radicchio Salad</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./swiss-chard-egg-casserole.html>Swiss Chard &amp;amp; Egg Casserole</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./swiss-chard-egg-casserole.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
