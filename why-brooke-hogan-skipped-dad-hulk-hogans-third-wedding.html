Her way of coping with that manifested in the form of distance. The main reason she decided not to attend her father’s third wedding, as she puts it, was to “create some distance between myself and my family” and spend time “focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals, and values.”</p><p>“As many of you know, I value my privacy, but unfortunately, a lot of media outlets are making assumptions as to why I did not attend my father’s third wedding. Instead of leaving it to speculation, I decided it’s better to shit it all down here.&nbsp;</p><p>As we all experience this with our own families, the dynamics of a family unit continuously change over the years.</p><p>With that being said, my family has experienced a LOT of change. With all of it happening in the public eye, I’ve had to learn how to best navigate those changes as they come, which has been difficult to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>For my my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family, and am focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals, and values.&nbsp;</p><p>I wish him well. ❤️”</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Brooke did not elaborate on the “beliefs, goals, and values” that differ between her and her family. In 2015, she and her father were embroiled in their biggest controversy to date after audio recordings of Hogan spewing a string of racist slurs toward Brooke’s then-boyfriend were leaked to the press. In the recordings, Hogan repeatedly called Brooke’s ex by the N-word, and referred to himself as “slightly racist.”</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Hogan apologized for his comments immediately thereafter and went on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC</a> in an interview with Amy Robach to ask for forgiveness and denounce any notion of racism. By this point, he’d already been fired from WWE and scrubbed from the online Hall of Fame. Brooke, on the other hand, stayed in her father’s corner, even publicly defending him in an exclusive interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a>.</p><p>“He’s my dad, I love him and the reason I’m standing by his side on this whole thing is because I know him, and it’s so easy for people to just — they need something to jump down people’s backs about. He’s an easy target.</p><p>“My dad’s best friends with Mr. T, he’s best friends with Dennis Rodman, he’s not racist. It’s just when you’re mad and you’re at the lowest point in your life …. you just choose ill-fitting words for that situation just to air your shorts out…He’s so nice to everybody. He doesn’t talk like that, which is what was so strange about it.”</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>There’s been little in the way of updates regarding Brooke and her father’s relationship in the years since the controversy. Today, the daughter of the wrestling legend is focusing her time and energy on her renovating design firm, BB Designs By Brooke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMm6mop5uaeqm7xpqlZqubnr2xscNmm5qcXZ3CrbeMoaagmZ6oerW0yKubZq%2BVmbGqusZo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-brooke-hogan-skipped-dad-hulk-hogans-third-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-brooke-hogan-skipped-dad-hulk-hogans-third-wedding.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-brooke-hogan-skipped-dad-hulk-hogans-third-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-brooke-hogan-skipped-dad-hulk-hogans-third-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-brooke-hogan-skipped-dad-hulk-hogans-third-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-brooke-hogan-skipped-dad-hulk-hogans-third-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left></div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tplink-announces-archer-ax6000-and-ax11000-wifi-6-80211ax-routers.html>TP-Link Announces Archer AX6000 and AX11000 Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) Routers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tplink-announces-archer-ax6000-and-ax11000-wifi-6-80211ax-routers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
